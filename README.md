# My-Custom-Govee-Integraton-for-SignalRGB
Integrate (at least 1 specific) Govee device with SignalRGB



# DOES NOT WORK!!! I COULD NEVER GET IT WORKING, YOU CAN TRY TO GET IT TO WORK YOURSELF IF YOU WANT



Made with ChatGPT as I do NOT know how to code.

Works with my Govee H615D LED Strip, it may work with more models.
You MUST get a Govee API key to use this. (Heres how: https://developer.govee.com/reference/apply-you-govee-api-key)
