# My Custom integration for SignalRGB to control Govee Devices

Integrate (at least 1 specific) Govee device with SignalRGB



# DOES NOT WORK!!! I COULD NEVER GET IT WORKING, YOU CAN TRY TO GET IT TO WORK YOURSELF IF YOU WANT



Made with ChatGPT as I do NOT know how to code.

Works with my Govee H615D LED Strip, it may work with more models.

You MUST get a Govee API key to use this. (Heres how: https://developer.govee.com/reference/apply-you-govee-api-key)

This is meant to control devices that do NOT have the LAN API option in device settings. If your device does have that, do NOT use this. Use the one built into SignalRGB
